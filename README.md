# African Centre for Statistics Country-Based Reporting Dashboard

## 1. Overview

A comprehensive dashboard system for the African Centre for Statistics (ACS) under United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), designed to manage and visualize country-based reporting data across strategic frameworks and programme performance reviews. 


The dashboard addresses the current lack of a centralized, dynamic platform for a country-level overview of ACS engagements. It aims to provide a clear and interactive overview of ACS activities and interventions in each African country, linked directly to UNECA's strategic frameworks.

The dashboard will help in monitoring ACS's delivery, identifying gaps, and reporting results, particularly at the country level.

## 2. Objectives

The dashboard is designed to:

- enable the visualization and management of ACS activities on a country-by-country basis, aligning them with the strategic priorities outlined in the Annual Business Plan (ABP) and the specific outputs defined within the Programme Planning and Budgeting (PPB) framework. 

- Display and manage country-level data obtained from the Accountability and Programme Performance Review Meeting (APPRM).

- Facilitate evidence-based reporting, strategic oversight, and coordination.
