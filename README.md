# African Centre for Statistics Country-Based Reporting Dashboard

This repository contains the concept and related documentation for the African Centre for Statistics (ACS) Country Engagement Dashboard, an internal reporting tool designed to enhance visibility, accountability, and strategic alignment of ACS interventions across African countries.


### 1. Overview

The ACS Country Engagement Dashboard addresses the current lack of a centralized, dynamic platform for a country-level overview of ACS engagements. 

It aims to provide a clear and interactive overview of ACS activities in each African country, linked directly to UNECA's strategic frameworks and delivery indicators. 

The dashboard will help in monitoring ACS's delivery, identifying gaps, and reporting results, particularly at the country level.


### 2. Objectives

The dashboard is designed to:

- Display ACS activities by country, mapped against Programme `Planning and Budgeting (PPB)` outputs and `Annual Business Plan (ABP)` priorities. 

- Facilitate evidence-based reporting, strategic oversight, and coordination. 

- Enhance accountability and visibility of country-level engagements. 

- Support tracking of delivery progress, status updates, and alignment with SDGs and Gender Marker coding. 

### 3. Core Features

The dashboard will include the following core features:


#### General Features
- Modern and clean React-based architecture
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Dark/Light theme support
- Data Export and Sharing: URL-based filter sharing
- It support page pagination for long content 

#### Interactive African Map
- Visual representation of intervention countries
- Responsive tooltips showing country information
- Multiple Country selection/deselection
- Selection counter and clear selection button
- Dynamic legends adapting to visualization modes


#### Advanced Filtering System
- Filter by Strategic Result Areas (4):
  - Production and Dissemination of Comparable Economic Data
  - Integration of Statistical and Geospatial Information Frameworks
  - Digital Transformation and Modernization of Statistical Systems
  - Improved CRVS System
- Sub-strategic result area filtering
- Country-specific filtering
- Partnership-based filtering
- Clear selection button


#### Detailed Report Cards
- Comprehensive project information display
- Expandable/collapsible detailed view
- Report cards showing intervention details including:
  - Strategic and sub-strategic result areas
  - Intervention country
  - Partnership information
  - Project year
  - SDG contributions
  - Supporting links
  - Detailed project descriptions

#### Data Visualization Components:
- Intervention Heat Map
- Regional Bar Chart showing intervention distribution

- The reporting dashboard is built using **React**, a popular **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces.

- **vite** is used for fast development.

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **ESLint** for code quality.

- **JSON** for data storage and structure.

- **GeoJSON** for geographical data mapping.


### 4. Implementation Plan (High-Level Timeline)

The implementation involves several key steps:
- Week 1: Review ABP and PPB documents. 
- Week 2: Define data structure and design the data collection tool. 
- Week 3: Pilot data collection with 3-5 countries and develop a prototype. 
- Week 5: Internal validation and feedback session. 
- Week 6: Finalize dashboard with full data and visualizations. 
- Week 7: Prepare Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and internal rollout, followed by final validation and approval. 


### 5. Information to be Collected

The dashboard will incorporate information across various ACS activities, including:

- Parliamentary Documentation and Substantive Meetings/Conferences (e.g., StatCom-Africa, UN-GGIM: Africa, CRVS Conference). 

- RPTC (Regular Programme for Technical Cooperation) Projects. 

- Seminars, Workshops, and Trainings. 

- Publications (country-relevant statistical publications). 

- Digital Products and Databases (e.g., eCASTAT, SDG Dashboards). 

- Advisory and Technical Support Services. 

- Outreach Events (e.g., Statistical Days, Geospatial Days). 

- Partnerships (UNCTs, inter-agency, bilateral, private sector, academia). 

### 6. Suggested Data Collection Form Contents (Google Form Structure)

The data collection will be structured into several sections, including:

- General Information (Country, ACS Section, Reporting Period). 

- Parliamentary Documentation & Conferences. 

- RPTC Projects. 

- XB Projects (Extra-Budgetary Projects). 

- DA Projects (Development Assistance Projects). 

- Seminars, Workshops, Trainings. 

- Publications. 

- Digital Tools & Databases. 

- Technical Advisory & Support. 

- Outreach Events. 

- Partnerships. 

- Strategic Linkages (SDGs, Cross-cutting Focus Areas). 

- Supporting Documentation.
